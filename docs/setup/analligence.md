# Getting Started Analligence Sandbox

## Prerequisites

* Email to signup or
* Allow Github signin or
* Allow Google signin

## Introduction

Sandbox environment is completly free to use. For typical multi user organization, we would suggest, one user create Next Time Space account or sign in with Google or Github. Then create Organization. Within organization, you can invite all your business management team users after they successfully signed up. You can use your personal email address or organization email address. The advantage of using organization email address is, you can allow any user from your same organization email domain to the organization, otherwise you need approve each and every user's organization join request.

### Organization Entrypoint

After you created account and signed in, you will be redirected to organization create or join page. Create one organization for you. Organization can hold multiple users. You will be the organization admin, and you can invite users, accept/reject if someone requested to join your organization.

### Workspace Entrypoint

After successfully created organization, you will be asked to create workspace. Workspace is something mapped to your different deployable environment. You may have environment like Development, Pre-production, Production. We can create multiple workspace based on the environment. Considering this is **Sandbox** environment, please configure your Dev or Pre-Prod environment. Once you create workspace.
