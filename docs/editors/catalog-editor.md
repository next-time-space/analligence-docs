# Catalogs

Catalogs editors allows you to organize your segments and engagement. Every page or collections of page will be referred by Catalogs.

>Ex. In an E-Com site, for browse or search page you can create one catalog, for product information page another catalog and map segments. In the following example, we will be creating catalog for browse page and find customer engagement on a browse page.

## Create Catalogs

1. Make sure you selected appropriate workspace from the header.
2. Click on **Create Catalog** button, side bar opens with inputs form.
3. Provide catalog name, should be unique for your workspace.
4. Provide a example URL where you could see all segments.
5. Select your page type.
6. **Do not include base href** is option to add a patch so your segment selection page will work fine. By default we don't need to check this box, if your page already has **base href** on page (`Ex. <base href="http://localhost/opencart/" />`), you need to check this box.
