# Segment Editor

Segment editor is an awesome intelligent editor which will show the very exact page you entered in the catalog URL with segment pointers. Segment pointer is something point to a specific html element.

In segment editor, we will create multiple segments from which we need to collect customer engagement.

>Ex. In our example, we are going to find the engagement on browse page. We are going to capture, on which browse page which product is more picked. In a PC/Desktop browse page, which desktop is being picked by more users.
